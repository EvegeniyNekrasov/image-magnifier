# Image Magnifier

```shell
cd image-magnifier
npm install
npm run dev
```

This mini project was created because I became curious after seeing the Amazon website. I noticed the effect they use on the page when you hover over the image, and it displays a larger version of the same image to see the details better.

And I thought to myself, 'will it be difficult to achieve this effect?'

It turned out it wasn't a big mystery to achieve it ))).
